# UnityDumpYard
Various tests and prototypes

## PLEASE NOTE:
This repository is supposed to contain all the various test projects created in unity, for easier sharing between people in the team. 

## TODO:
We need a proper license for the whole repo.. Probably something that says that we own everything and no one can use it, but it is still open source?
